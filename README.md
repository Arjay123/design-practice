Repo to store practice for web design implementations

In an effort to improve my UI Design skills, I have taken the DailyUI 100 day challenge. This challenge emails you a design prompt every day (M-F) that allows you to flex your creative muscles and share your work with the DailyUI community on Dribbble or Twitter. I believe the challenge was designed for users to create mockups using wireframing tools, but I've decided to implement my designs with HTML, CSS, and JS to flex my Front End skills as well as UI/UX.
